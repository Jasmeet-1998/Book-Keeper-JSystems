1. Book-Keeper UI

- Nextjs
- Next-Auth (OAuth/Single sign in/magic email link)
- chakra UI
- framer motion (for animations)
- zustand (as minimal&simplistic state manager)

2. Backend

- typescript
- trpc [mutations & queries(abstractly based on react-query) procedures]
- prisma "postgreSQL" [supabase](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/integrations/prisma) for cloud hosting the postgres instance with prisma

Misc:

- QR Code Based Authenticator for MFA
- cloudinary (media[images/videos] cloud hosting) https://console.cloudinary.com/users/login
- for geolocation & reverse geocoding https://www.bigdatacloud.com/
- opentelemetry for tracing & instrumentation of prisma queries and trpc mutations & queries
  note- automatic instrumentation cannot be established for trpc right now as their is no supported instrumentation library for trpc reff: https://opentelemetry.io/registry/?component=instrumentation

- âœ¨ dockerized jaeger for visualization of traces, can be activate by uncommenting the jaegerExporter and commenting out the consoleExporter lines in opentelemetry.tracing.ts in utils of this project.

                docker-compose up -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.jaeger.yaml up -d
                # access jaeger UI at
                localhost:16686

1.  setup/nextAuth & OauthSignIn with session data barebones managment

```bash

=============== Task List ================

- [x] setup & wire up login page. https://next-auth.js.org/providers/google go to -> https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials -> create new project -> create credentials selecting the newly created project -> Oauth Client ID & select web application
add redirect uri http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google & use client ID & secret to configure provider in nextjs provider section

- [x] email server setup for magic email login, and dispatching
emails to users https://my.sendinblue.com/dashboard or https://www.siteground.com/kb/gmail-smtp-server/

- [x] sort prisma+supabase+nextjs integration, maintain session data inside postgresql hosted DB ref: https://next-auth.js.org/adapters/supabase

        API URL and Keys
        Go to the Settings page in the Dashboard.
        Click API in the sidebar.
        Find your API URL , anon , and service_role keys on this page.

- [x] templating dispatched emails, https://www.npmjs.com/package/handlebars, https://www.litmus.com/blog/a-guide-to-bulletproof-buttons-in-email-design

        # IMPORTANT, for html content over email use port 465 to serve html over TLS in smtp , port 587 wont work
        https://forum.gitlab.com/t/smtp-fail-to-send-email-due-to-ssl-wrong-version-number/33008/2

- [x] welcome email for new user signup when they login directly via sign in email magic link 'createUser event' next-auth events https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/events

> 2. tweaks/signup-and-schema

```bash

- [x] sort/patch/update schema for contact, cards, user

- [x] barebones & research session & state managment setup via zustand ðŸŽˆ though look out for this-> https://github.com/acdlite/rfcs/blob/first-class-promises/text/0000-first-class-support-for-promises.md#conditionally-suspending-on-data , maybe state managment will become obsolete altogether when this feature rolls out & nextjs already makes the state managment obsolete with this approach with ssr & server side data fetches.

- [x] add session restriction for each page & component, only logged in user allowed to visit dashboard and other pages

- [x] redirect user to settings page if they  phone number is set null in DB yet as this means that the user directly signed in cum sign up via mail magic link or Oauth sign in and it created user in our DB.

- [x] provide each settings section with user data from db

```

> 3. dev/trpc-flows (reff: https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/relation-queries)

- [x] getting user data and session data from db

- [x] setup authorizations trpc , context check using middleware to authorize trpc client request to trpc server ref: https://trpc.io/docs/authorization#option-2-authorize-using-middleware,

- [x] make public procedure call to trpc/server to activate rpc access for user get jwt via seprate route and attach jwt in request body for user info from dashboard and store both rpc token and the user info in the zustand store for other componenets protected routes access.

- [x] setup a rpc access route that is used just to determine wheather rpc access is allowed or not for a page by using stored zustand token if this protected/tracked call fails navigate user to dashboard , this should be in every main page so that repopulate/rotation of the token can be done with auto update in zustand store via dashoard fetch rpc token call

- [x] MFA setup, that will add extra layer of verification of feeding in the generateed authenticator app code when user wants to delete account or update account plan i.e account specific services.

- [x] clean up & remove the irrelevant schema or unused code
      throught project directory.

reff: https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/filtering-and-sorting

- [x] wrap up and make sure each filter, update, add contact by user & change in settings or deleting user account (active: false dont actually delete user account completely) is sorted in reff to frontend end-to-end to backend trpc server call & setup.

- [x] add mfa check for deleting account, if mfa enabled have dynamic pin section popped up in the delete modal alert , also check authentication code when hitting the delete mutation in backend if mfa is enabled, check mfaEnabled both frontend(UI) and backend.

- [x] uncomment the use effect redirects, that are commented out & test,
      [TOKEN ROTATION] have a sessionedRoute that checks for the validity of jwt token stored in zustand
      if its not valid the redirect user to dashboard to load up and refresh the token from trpc server into zustand store automatically, have this mutation called in parent pages settings,invoices,contacts only and apply the redirection their just exclude dashboard page

- [x] reusable fingerprint method for INTERNAL (that handles the logging of IP, access points, device info & geolocation from the trpc middleware sessionTracker only, and then store against relevant user in DB to show in settings account) &

- [x] email subscription enabled will new dispatched email named email subscription to user account on new package availability, account package update, deletion of account on user personal mail.

- [x] report bug in app email sending feature, sending email to my email when anyone write emails to me via handlebars and trpc server send email procedure exposed to users report bug in settings section

- [x] DB monitoring setup open-telimetry tracing https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/opentelemetry-tracing, probability sampling to reduce traces & spans in production env reff: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/trace/tracestate-probability-sampling/ & https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/trace/sdk/#traceidratiobased reff: opentelemetry.tracing.ts in utils folder of the project

- [x] âœ¨ add dockerized jaegar for visualizing traces for future use-cases

1.  setup/nextAuth & OauthSignIn with session data barebones managment

```bash

=============== Task List ================

- [x] setup & wire up login page. https://next-auth.js.org/providers/google go to -> https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials -> create new project -> create credentials selecting the newly created project -> Oauth Client ID & select web application
add redirect uri http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google & use client ID & secret to configure provider in nextjs provider section

- [x] sort prisma+supabase+nextjs integration, maintain session data inside postgresql hosted DB ref: https://next-auth.js.org/adapters/supabase

        API URL and Keys
        Go to the Settings page in the Dashboard.
        Click API in the sidebar.
        Find your API URL , anon , and service_role keys on this page.

- [x] templating dispatched emails, https://www.npmjs.com/package/handlebars, https://www.litmus.com/blog/a-guide-to-bulletproof-buttons-in-email-design

        # IMPORTANT, for html content over email use port 465 to serve html over TLS in smtp , port 587 wont work
        https://forum.gitlab.com/t/smtp-fail-to-send-email-due-to-ssl-wrong-version-number/33008/2

- [x] welcome email for new user signup when they login directly via sign in email magic link 'createUser event' next-auth events https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/events

> 2. tweaks/signup-and-schema

```bash

- [x] sort/patch/update schema for contact, cards, user

- [x] barebones & research session & state managment setup via zustand ðŸŽˆ though look out for this-> https://github.com/acdlite/rfcs/blob/first-class-promises/text/0000-first-class-support-for-promises.md#conditionally-suspending-on-data , maybe state managment will become obsolete altogether when this feature rolls out & nextjs already makes the state managment obsolete with this approach with ssr & server side data fetches.

- [x] add session restriction for each page & component, only logged in user allowed to visit dashboard and other pages

- [x] redirect user to settings page if they  phone number is set null in DB yet as this means that the user directly signed in cum sign up via mail magic link or Oauth sign in and it created user in our DB.

- [x] provide each settings section with user data from db

```
